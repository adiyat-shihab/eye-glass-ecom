**Organisms are higher-level components that combine  atoms to form distinct sections or modules within a UI. They represent cohesive groups of UI elements that work together to fulfill a specific purpose or achieve a common goal. Organisms are larger and more complex, often encompassing multiple layers of interaction and functionality. Examples of organisms include headers, footers, product cards, sidebars, and feature sections. They serve as re-usable patterns that can be easily replicated and customized across different pages or interfaces.**
