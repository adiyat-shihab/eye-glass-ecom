**Atoms, the foundational building blocks of a UI design, are like the DNA of your interface. They represent the smallest, indivisible elements, such as buttons, input fields, icons, and text labels. At this level, atoms encapsulate basic HTML elements or simple UI components that cannot be broken down further without losing their meaning or functionality. They typically have predefined styles and properties that can be reused across the entire design system. By establishing consistent patterns at the atomic level, designers and developers ensure uniformity and maintainability throughout the UI.**
