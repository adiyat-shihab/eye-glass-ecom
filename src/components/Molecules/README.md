**Molecules are combinations of atoms that work together as functional units. They represent relatively simple UI components that consist of two or more atoms grouped to perform a specific task or convey a particular piece of information. Examples of molecules include forms, buttons with icons, navigation bars, and search bars. Unlike atoms, molecules are more complex and can have their own unique properties and behaviors. They serve as re-usable building blocks for creating larger, more intricate components in the UI.**
